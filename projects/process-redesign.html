            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This product redesign proposal was conducted out of self-interest in my own time for my previous work
                term. I conducted this study to explore avenues in which mapping of data, information access cost, and
                the overall experience of the application in question could be improved.

                The application discussed is a business process management system which provides a number of process
                templates to achieve some business goal. The templates are composed of reusable “blocks” which are
                classified as automated (code driven) or manual (requiring human intervention).
            </p>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                From a user experience standpoint, the application considered can become incredibly complex as several
                blocks are used in tandem to construct varying business processes. For especially convoluted processes,
                it becomes necessary to present a user interface that provides the information in a coherent manner so
                that the state of a process can be quickly discerned.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application itself had not involved any designers throughout the development process and thus the
                UI/UX focus is lacking in many parts of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the current application, users refer to the processes page in which they select the active process of
                interest from a list of processes. Figure 1 below shows the possible options. The problem lies in the
                fact that the screen shows fragmented bits of information leaving the onus on the user to make sense of
                everything.

            <h3>User Journey</h3>
            <p>
                There are two primary user personas to consider: the process administrator and the task worker. The
                process administrator user was focused because the role has more complicated patterns of application
                usage. Figure 2 demonstrates some of the major journey breakdowns. The focus of this case study was to
                enhance the understanding of an active process state.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information about the different personas came from qualitative data the team had about client business
                and user requirements.

            <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                Before considering solutions, an initial heuristic evaluation was conducted on the current application
                state. The main principles referenced came from Wickens’ principles from An Introduction to Human
                Factors Engineering and Norman’s principles of interaction design from The Design of Everyday Things.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the evaluation conducted, it was found that the current application demonstrates weak
                <b>mapping</b> of
                data between the process history and process diagram. The process diagram is a static image which cannot
                be interacted with restricting the user from directly manipulating the diagram to query for information.
                The two sets of data are tightly coupled, but the UI fails to demonstrate such relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application also violates attentional principles of display, namely the increase in <b>information
                    access cost</b> due to a lack of visual proximity of the data. This causes the user to have to
                constantly shift contexts which in turn affects their attentional and working memory resources.
            </p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                Some initial sketches were done to consider varying low-fidelity prototypes. The most convincing concept
                sketch involved combining the process history and process diagram into a unified display.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../assets/projects/process/lfp.jpg" alt="A few concept sketches" />
                <figcaption>Figure 4: Numerous wireframes and considerations of user flow were drawn (all low-fidelity
                    documents produced are available upon request).
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Some key features of the redesign can be seen in figure 5 below. The process events window serves as the
                source of truth as the process history. This is in contrast from the current application which does not
                include every event (i.e. process documents are in a separate tab). The process events can then be
                filtered and searched to quickly find events of interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further indicate the strong coupling between the process events window and the process diagram, a
                block from the diagram can be selected which then filters process events to the relevant events which
                occurred in the block.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Conducting the redesign process was very engaging and challenging. It was very hard initially to
                understand the different user journeys because the application itself can be very complicated. As a
                result, initial time was taken to understand the application itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the presented iteration, next steps for the redesign might be to conduct usability tests on
                administrators or mock internal users without. The focus would be on observing how the user gains an
                understanding of an active process and whether the changes make this challenge more efficient
                and accurate. Feedback provided would help guide the next design iteration before implementation is
                considered.
